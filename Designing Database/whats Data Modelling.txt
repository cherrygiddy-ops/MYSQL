Its a process of creating a model for the data we want  to store in the database

        Name four steps of data Modelling
1.understanding the requirement i.e talking to end users,dormain experts,looking at existing forms ,applications even database
2.building a conceptual model ->involve identifying entities or conceps in business and their relationship with each other->also its a visual representation that we uses to communicate  with stakeholders so that we know we are on the same page
3.build a logical model ->data structure for storing data ,abstract data model that's independence of db technonlogy its shows tables and columns we need .
4.build a physical model->refine logical model to build a physical model,implement a logical model specific to db technology i.e exact data type,default values for columns,views stored procedures and functions

           how to demonstrate entities
1.entity relationship
2.uml diagram
          relationship of entities
1.one to one
2.one to many
3.many to many
        
              Normalization
->a process of reviewing our design to make sure that it follows predesign rules to prevent data duplication
        
           They are  7 normal Form
1.1ST Normal Form -> each cell should have a Single value and we can not have repeated columns

N/B -> In relational database we don't have many to many relationship we have only 1.one to one relationship
and 2.one to many relationship

2.2END NORMAL Form ->to qualify for second Normal Form a relation must
1.be in first Normal form 
2.Every table should describe one entity and every column in that table should describe that entity

3.3RD NORMAL FORM 
  ->The entity is in the second normal form
  ->a column in a table should not be derived from other columns since it will lead to data inconsistency  and data duplication
